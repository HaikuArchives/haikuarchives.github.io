# About Haiku Software Archives

##### The Haiku Software Archives was founded in 2013 by @waddlesplash due to the fact that all over the web, BeOS and Haiku programs were vanishing â€” often never to be seen again. The purpose of HaikuArchives is to archive the source code to any BeOS or Haiku program so that it might not be lost.

##### If you have a Haiku or BeOS app (either yours or third-party) that is open source and not actively maintained, you can contact @waddlesplash by sending him a message on the Haiku forums, @mentioning him on Twitter, or by sending email to haikuarchives [at] gmail <dot> com.
